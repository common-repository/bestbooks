 * Liabilities, Equity, and Revenue
 * --------------------------------
 * Liability, Equity, and Revenue accounts usually receive credits, 
 * so they maintain negative balances. They are called credit accounts. 
 * Accounting books will say “Accounts that normally maintain a negative balance 
 * are increased with a Credit and decreased with a Debit.” 
 * Again, look at the number line. 
 * If you add a negative number (credit) to a negative number, 
 * you get a larger negative number! (moving left on the number line). 
 * But if you start with a negative number and add a positive number to it (debit), 
 * you get a smaller negative number because you move to the right on the number line.
