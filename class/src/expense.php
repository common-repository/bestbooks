 * Asset and Expense
 * -----------------
 * Because Asset and Expense accounts maintain positive balances, 
 * they are positive, or debit accounts. Accounting books will say 
 * “Accounts that normally have a positive balance are increased with a Debit 
 * and decreased with a Credit.” Of course they are! Look at the number line. 
 * If you add a positive number (debit) to a positive number, 
 * you get a bigger positive number. But if you start with a positive number 
 * and add a negative number (credit), you get a smaller positive number 
 * (you move left on the number line). The asset account called Cash, 
 * or the checking account, is unique in that it routinely receives debits 
 * and credits, but its goal is to maintain a positive balance.
